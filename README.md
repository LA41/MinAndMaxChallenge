# MinAndMaxChallenge
This app finds minimum and maximum value the user typed in. I used endless while loop to prompt user for an integer (and scanner to get piece of information from a user, of course). App will break out of the loop as soon as non-integer value is prompted.

Kinda teeny-weeny exercise while getting more and more practice in Java ;)
